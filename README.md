- ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @lthealy, a current GS4 at the Stony Brook University Biomedical Informatics Department. Soon to be MS3 at Renaissance School of Medicine.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using computational ability to ensure reproducibility through flexible containerization of open-source, open-access code and careful dataset curation and maintenance. My field of focus is the intersection of molecular, histological, and immunological markers of clinical outcomes in solid tumors, primarily PDAC and breast cancer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m proficient in R, Bash, Azure VM management, and Rstudio management, with foundational skills in SQL, Python, and PHP. Currently working on containerization of deep learning pipelines using Docker and Singularity, as well as the management of a PDAC subtyping R package/web app.
